Authorizations are created to reserve an amount that can later be captured, that is tranferred from the card owners account. CardFunc offers several ways to create an authorization. The CardFunc Element can be integrated into your system and used for entering sensitive card data. Authorizations can also be created using account tokens, once an account has been created for an end-user. Authorizations can also be created using PANs directly.
