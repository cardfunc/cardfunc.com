_Authorizations_ are created to reserve an amount that can later be _captured_, that is tranferred from the card owners account. CardFunc offers several ways to create an authorization. The _CardFunc Element_ can be integrated into your system and used for entering sensitive card data. Authorizations can also be created using _account tokens_, once an account has been created for an end-user. Authorizations can also be created _using PANs directly_.
