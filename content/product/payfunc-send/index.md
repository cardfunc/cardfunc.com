# Creating an order
After logging into your account at portal.payfunc.com, you can create a new order, either using a customer's phone number or email address as contact information and either entering the total order amount without specifying details or entering information for every order item.

### Example order creation

# Sending an order
Once all order information has been entered and confirmed, an sms or email containing a link to PayFunc Checkout will be sent to your customer.

# PayFunc Checkout
Clicking on the link will send your customer to PayFunc Checkout, where the order amount and any specification of order items included can be viewed before the customer chooses one of the payment options that your contract includes. Upon completing payment, your customer will be sent do a confirmation page or, in case the chosen payment method is unsuccessful, a page describing the failure.
