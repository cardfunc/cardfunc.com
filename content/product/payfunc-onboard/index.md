PayFunc Onboard is a dialog to onboard customers to PayFunc based services.
<!--more-->

Through the integrated PayFunc Onboard service, your customers only need to enter their card data once for a certain card. Once the customer has provided the card data, a customer account will be created in our system and you will receive a token representing the account that can be used e.g. for any recurring payments the customer may have or in one-click ordering solutions.
